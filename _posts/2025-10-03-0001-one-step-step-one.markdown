My very first interview was a mock one at a university job fair. 
It was a risk-free way to test my knowledge with a professional. 
I had clear gaps, and I made trivial mistakes, but he was very kind about it. 
He was an alumni, and he was there to help students like me. 
He recommended a fun book about Python and introduced me to the company where I would end up spending the next ten years. 

He may not even know what impact he had on me, but soon after becoming a full-time developer, I got myself involved in recruitment. 
I wanted to make the first interview experience good and memorable for as many students as I could. 
I imagine, for many this is a scary journey to begin, but here I am to help you make one step, step one. 

In this series, I will introduce you to a 5+1 step approach, 
that I recommend to most of my students who are preparing for a coding interview. 
1. Start with the things you know [[{{ "#0002 — The Things They Showed You" }}]({% post_url 2025-10-04-0002-the-things-they-showed-you %})]
2. Solidify your understanding of the problem [[{{ "#0003 — The Things They Hid From You" }}]({% post_url 2025-10-05-0003-the-things-they-hid-from-you %})]
3. Use your intuition
4. Just write it down
5. Don't stop, analyse
6. Be flexible

You may ask, why do I start with coding first? 
While there is a lot (way more, in fact) to talk about regarding theoretical questions, 
those interviews are usually similar to a university oral exam, so they should be at least somewhat familiar. 
Coding, however, feels foreign and intimidating to many. 

Sadly, I can't promise a one-size-fits-all solution, 
but I can give you a solid foundation and some insight into what an interviewer may be looking for. 
To what I'm looking for in an entry level candidate.
Keep in mind that every company has a different approach to interviewing, and even within a company, interviewers may differ.
One thing however is common: they all appreciate if a candidate puts in the effort and comes prepared.
And that's what you're about to do now.

Without further ado, let’s start with a simple coding task. 

**Problem Statement:** 
```
Given two words, decide if they are anagrams. 
An anagram is a word or phrase formed by rearranging the letters of another,
such as THING and NIGHT. 
```
⚡ **Your Turn**: Try solving the problem on your own, and if you can, measure how much time did it take. 

When (you assume) you’re ready, continue with [{{ page.next.title }}]({{ page.next.url }}).
